# 0x0C. N Queens

Using a regular chess board, the challenge is to place eight queens on the board such that no queen is attacking any of the others. (For those not familiar with chess pieces, the queen is able to attack any square on the same row, any square on the same column, and also any square on either of the diagonals).

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.
